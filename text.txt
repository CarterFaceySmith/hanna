Three things appear before you
A mouse scurries out from under the door of the hut
It stares into your eyes and mutters the words
‚ÄúOnly one of three has the ability to catch me, choose wisely or it shall not be thee‚Äù
The mouse is a scruffy fellow
Tufts of fur protrude from his skin in a ptchwork fashion
Scars lace his face and you can see he had a single gold tooth

*chooses the cheese trap*
He glances at the cheese trap then swiftly back at you
‚ÄúFoolish girl.‚Äù With a gambler‚Äôs grace he deftly swipes the cheese from the trap, before somewhat drunkenly somersaulting from its grasp
He greedily eyes the slot machine, fingering his gold tooth nervously before darting back into the hut
NOOOO

*puts a gold coin in the slot machine*
The slot machine stands silent before you, a 1, a 4 and a bright red 7 grace the three large dials of the main face, your coin disappears into the slot and a small counter clicks to 1 above it

*puts another gold coin in the slot machine*
The slot machine stands silent before you, a 1, a 4 and a bright red 7 grace the three large dials of the main face, your coin disappears into the slot and a small counter clicks to 2 above it
Out of the corner of your eye the handle of the machine gleams in the sun, begging to be pulled, you think about trying your luck
HAHAHAH FUCK HAHAHAHAHAH
I‚Äôm so fuckin dumb

*pulls the lever*
The dials chunk to life, emitting a low rumbling before flashing into rotation, the only sound you hear is the clinking of metal on metal as the machine whirrs over the faint whisper of the wind
You watch with wide eyes as the machine begins to float slowly off the ground
As it reaches your eye height the first dial abruptly stops‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
wtf
*clings onto the slot machine so it doesn‚Äôt float away*

You cling to the machine, a bright red 7 stares back at you from the first dial, the other two whirr faster, seemingly agitated by this turn if events
*of events
The machine floats statically before you, a rumbling begins in the distance

oh shite
Suddenly the second dial slows to a crawl, a 1 ticks past, then a 3, a 6, and finally a 2 slowly trickles past
A loud chunk can be heard deep from within the dial and it snaps to a bright red 7, staring back at you ominously, just like the first

fuck yea
The rumblings grow louder, the machine begins to hum a low note from within its depths

third dial?
The earth beneath your feet begins to creak and groan as roots break the surface of the dirt, writhing like snakes beneath your feet
The third dial whirls onwards
The low note from the machine grows louder
A violent mechanical shrieking can be heard from inside your head
It seems to be coming from everywhere and nowhere
*CA-CHUNK*
The dial settles on red
Three crimson sevens stand silently in a row across the face of the machine, all sound stops
I won!!!!!

do I get something
The drawer of the machine slowly creaks open, revealing your prize, a gleaming golden tooth rolls idly to the end of the drawer
OH FUCK YEA
*takes the gold tooth*

*knocks on the hut, leaving the gold tooth by the door*
The mouse darts out from under the door, swiftly yoinking the tooth from the dirt, polishing it feverishly it asks you a question
"I won't ask how you got this back for me, the price may already be higher than your realise, just tell me what you want for it"
oh shit um
the golden key, the handle is the shape of a bird and it opens the door to the castle on the mountain
